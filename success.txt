After I heard about this initiative, I have been telling my friends that ecole is the best way to impart our knowledge to the one's who need it to change their lives. Ecole will help me, and million other houswives across the globe, to utilise our time in a more productive manner. We will feel more connected to the world and would be able to make a difference in somebody's life somewhere.

After my retirement I have a lot of time on my hands. ecole looks promising to people like me across the globe. Technology and education, when combined can do wonders, especially in India where quality of eduaction is poor and inaccessible to a majority of population. Looking forward to use this website. All the best, team Technologues.
